This is how to open Rust on MAC terminal with the different command lines:
(This assumes that you have Rust installed on your laptop already)

Change the directory first:
```
cd [directory of your file]
cd rust_proj_CoE_164
```
*** If you do not have a directory:
```
mkdir [name of directory]

nano learning_rust.rs
```
